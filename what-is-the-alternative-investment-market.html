It includes things like hedge funds, private equity, real estate investment trusts and other private equity funds. The alternative investment market is also sometimes referred to as the secondary market or the private equity secondary market. The alternative investment market has grown significantly over the last few decades because of the amount of capital being invested in these types of funds. There are many advantages to investing in these funds as opposed to primary markets like stocks and bonds. The alternative investment market has grown from $2 billion in the late 1990s to $8.5 trillion in 2017. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 15.3% from 1999 to 2017. This growth in the alternative investment market is due to an increase in the amount of capital being invested in these types of funds. The alternative investment market has grown even more recently with the rise of technology and the internet. This has brought more people into the market and opened up new investment opportunities for everyone. The alternative investment market is also referred to as the secondary market because it serves as an outlet for investments that have already been made. This allows investors to sell their investments on the secondary market without having to sell them directly to another investor. This also allows investors to make money in the alternative investment market by buying and selling shares in different funds. The alternative investment market includes many different types of funds.
